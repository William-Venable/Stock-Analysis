# Green-Energy Stock 2017-2018
Purpose: Using Green-Energy stock data provided by Steve, we are able to analyze and produce a return percentage based on data from 2017 and 2018. We are able to efficiently and effectively use VBA to format and provide an outcome that is easy to read for anyone that decides to look at the spreadsheet.

Analysis: Based on the data that Steve provided us, we were able to determine that 2017 had a far higher return rate across all stocks as opposed to 2018. We can see that in the images below, that mainly two of the twelve stocks that were invested in, ENPH and RUN, have held strong, or increased in return percentage through the year.

Given the vast amount of data, we were able to utilize VBA to quickly round up the information that Steve wanted, and we were able to clearly display a table of whatever data he requested based on year (2017 or 2018) in less than a second.

Conclusions: In regards to the actual challenge itself, I would say that I struggled a bit. I had an issue with the standard module where I was unable to utilize the yearValueAnalysis subroutine, but was able to overcome it with the help of my classmates. As far as refactoring the code goes though, I was able to move through it smoothly. I think in general it is a lot easier to understand, and you're able to see any errors a bit easier. I do however think it is time consuming based on what you are refactoring. For example, I think using the VBA script of the modules, refactoring was very efficient. There wasn't a lot to change and any errors made that affected the table were easy to spot. However, coming from someone that has never touched VBA before, it was a bit of a challenge and did take multiple hours of staring at my screen to fully complete the challenge.
